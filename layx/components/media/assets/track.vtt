00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.662
With you on my mind

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.480
Cause your aura got me hypnotized

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:17.617
All the smiles and looks we can't undo

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.864
Make me think you want me too

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:23.691
All the stories in your mind

00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:26.830
From your lips straight to my heart

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm feeling like you're hiding
miles above, miles above

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.307
That's the rhythm of a higher
love, higher love

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:36.624
Heart is racing, goes like
hi love, hi love

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:39.754
Take my hand and fly me higher, higher

6 AM now

00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:58.994
Sky is falling down

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.136
Almost sunrise in this messy town

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:09.051
What's on your mind?

00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.001
You feel it too when we're together?

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.376
The way you speak

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:14.376
It takes me right back to forever

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:15.747
You twist and turn me

00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:17.600
Keep on changing like the weather

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:18.912
I know you're here

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.822
And this is stronger than the pressure

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.495
All the smiles and looks we can't undo

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:27.000
Make me think you want me too

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:30.000

From your lips straight to my heart

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:02.293
Summer on repeat

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:04.126
Maybe you could take me back

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:05.852
August diaries

00:02:07.383 --> 00:02:09.030
More than memories

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.725
Take my story right now

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:12.725
Give it to the seas

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:15.879
I'm feeling like you're hiding
